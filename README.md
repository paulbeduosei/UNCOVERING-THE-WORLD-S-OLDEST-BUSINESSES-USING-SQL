# UNCOVERING-THE-WORLD-S-OLDEST-BUSINESSES-USING-SQL
Just wrapped up a fascinating data project exploring the world’s oldest businesses — from Staffelter Hof Winery (founded in 862!) to centuries-old companies that survived empires, wars, and major global shifts.

Using multiple CSV files from BusinessFinancing.co.uk, I used data joining and manipulation techniques to bring all datasets together and analyze what kinds of companies have managed to remain in business for hundreds — and sometimes over a thousand — years.

This project was the perfect blend of history and data analytics, showing how long-term resilience can be uncovered through the right data transformations.

This project analyzes the oldest continuously operating companies across the world using cleaned datasets provided in multiple CSV files. I used SQL joins and data manipulation techniques to merge the data, explore founding dates, compare industries, and identify characteristics shared by long-lasting businesses.
